# thumbs_up
My attempt to train SDXL to generate images of celebrities showing thumbs up by using Dreambooth with LoRA adaptors. The code is fairly messy and specific to my compute setup, so it likely won't work for others out of the box, although the notebook should.

I used `run_sweep.py` to run a small hyperparameter sweep and `evaluate_runs` to evaluate completed runs.

To view results of the sweep open the colab notebook `main.ipynb`.
